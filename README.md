  # Python Samples
  Shows different frameworks to work with Python.

  ## First Steps

  To create a virtual environment we can do it with Anaconda. However, it is more advisable to do it manually by activating VirtuaEnv. In this way we can manually install the packages that we need and avoid conflicting with any library. It is better to install them manually so that when generating the requirements file it only contains the libraries that we have been installing throughout the project.

  - Create virtual environment

    virtualenv <name>

    - [x] For Linux and Windows it´s the same comman

  - Activate  virtual environment

    ###### Windows

      We position ourselves in the project folder

        .\env\Scripts\activate

      - [x] Another way is to browse the folders and activate

        cd /env/Script/activate

    ###### Linux

      source env/bin/activate  

    Now we need to do a pip list to see the libraries we have installed. Only a few should appear by default. If we do it with Anaconda many appear.
